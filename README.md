## Hi there 👋

I'm Shafiullah, a Unity Developer based in India.

I work with Unity, C#, AR/VR, and scalable code architecture, focusing on performance-driven and maintainable systems.

I’m currently learning Go and .NET Core to strengthen my backend and real-time system design skills. This GitHub is a space for experiments, architectural patterns, and in-progress builds.
